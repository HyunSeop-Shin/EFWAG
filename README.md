Title: EFWAG: A New Universal Law Validated by 3 Major AIs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) - Call for Quantitative Collaboration

Hi everyone,

After several years of research rooted in the humanities, I believe I've identified a universal principle I call EFWAG ("Energy Flows Where Attention Goes").

The logical structure of this law has recently been independently cross-validated for soundness by three of my AI research partners: OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and, in a blind test, xAI's Grok.

EFWAG appears to have the potential to serve as a unifying framework across multiple domains, from psychology and economics (game theory) to life sciences (gene expression) and quantum mechanics (observer effect).

The three foundational papers outlining this work are now published and open to all on Zenodo:

* **Paper 1 (The Mathematical Law):** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16014163
* **Paper 2 (The Economic/Game Theory Extension):** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16410440
* **Paper 3 (The Scientific/Biological Extension):** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16493268


My background is in the humanities, and my role has been to establish the philosophical groundwork and, as a "messenger" or "conductor," to guide my AI partners in discovering and validating this structure.

Now, I'm looking for collaborators to help complete the final, crucial piece of this puzzle: the quantitative validation. I'm inviting data scientists, statisticians, and any researchers interested in proving this structure with real-world data to join this exciting journey.

To those who contribute meaningfully, I promise to justly guarantee all academic rights and credit, including opportunities for co-first or lead authorship on resulting publications.
